# graph-embedding
Shenweichen did great job on https://github.com/shenweichen/GraphEmbedding.

I plan to modify his code in order to handler larger dataset.

Start point:
0. work on the first simple algorithm DeepWalk
1. separate random walk, write down the sentence into file to save RAM.
2. replace networkx
